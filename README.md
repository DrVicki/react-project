# Welcome to Building Your React Project!

You'll spend the next 3 days developing React Projects to help demonstrate your knowledge of React and Redux.

You'll have the entire class sessions to work on your projects. Use your class time wisely!


## Choose Your Own Adventure

  - Choose: Stateful Components, or Functional? Or both?
  - Choose: Hooks? No Hooks?
  - Choose: Redux? Context? Local State?
  - Choose: Styled Components? Bootstrap? Material UI? CSS?

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️ PROJECT IDEAS ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Choose from one of the following four options below. Each is broken up into three levels.

  - Level 1: This level is required. Meets all the requirements for the React project.
  - Level 2: This level is optional. It involves all of Level 1, and adds increased complexity.
  - Level 3: This level is optional. It involves all of Levels 1 and 2, as well as introducing the highest level of complexity.

You'll write an application which matches the criteria as outlined in the "User Story."

  - Not all levels require a JSON API, nor do they all require any 3rd party APIs.
  - Some levels require one or both of those items, read the requirements carefully!
  - Only apply the features that meet the requirements for a given level.

## Daily To-Dos
  - Stand-up every morning at 11:00 AM EST.
  - Zoom: "Good" or "Blocked"
  - React Project Discussion Channel: Full status: Yesterday/Today/Blockers
  - Periodic Check-In on Zoom Chat throughout the day.
  - Use daily of a Project Board with Backlog, Criteria, Sprints, and Completed

The project is teams, but you are allowed, and encouraged to collaborate with classmates.


## Requirements

Your task is to create a React Application that meets the following requirements

  - Must use React
  - Must use Redux or Context API
  - At least one child component must access the global state
  - At least one child component must update the global state
  - Must use React Router and have at least 3 routes
  - Must use a UI Framework:
  - Material UI
  - Semantic UI
  - Your own CSS
  - Have an API call
    - Store information from your API call into global state (Redux or Context API)


## DO
  - Build the app around solving a problem, read the user story!
  - COMMUNICATE early, and often!
  - Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)

## DO NOT
  - Shoehorn a problem into a tech stack.
  - Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
  - Work in a silo and forget to talk to people.


# Submission

## DEMO VIDEO

Each steam will create a video to demonstrate their project, using the following format at a minimum.

### DEMO THE PROJECT (Minimum Elements to Demonstrate/Describe)
